# Milestone 2 â€“ Database Design 

This milestone will include the design component of the project.  Groups will progress through the data modeling and normalization processes in order to finalize a database design.  Working within their group and in consultation with your professor, students will practice the processes learned in class to design a relational database.

## ERD: 
Groups will create a UML Entity Relationship Diagram of their database design following the database modeling process.  This design should then be checked to be compliant 3rd normal form through the normalization techniques learned in class.
Data Dictionary: Groups will produce a data dictionary for each of their designed tables.  This data dictionary will include the same information as the ERD in table format in addition to data types, sizes, notes, and example data.
